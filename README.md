A simple Compass Android app with FlashLight.

Yes! It has nothing else. Just a damn Compass.
(And supports Android 10+ auto dark mode).

Made while learning how to sign apps and how to deploy them to Google Play Store (unfortunately didn't did the 2nd task as there is a $25 charge for registering as a developer on Google Play Developer Console.)

No other language support.
